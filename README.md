    You are expected to develop a simple Shell application capable of executing a few basic commands that can be extended later. The given skeleton code consists of
    three Java classes:
    
    GenericCommand.java: This represents a generic command. A new command should extend this class and overwrite handleCommand() method.
    Shell.java: This represents the basic shell class. To add a new command to the shell, you should implement the corresponding class and add the command in this class.
    Quit.java: This is an implementation of quit command.
    
    You are required to get familiar with the given code and extend the application to satisfy the functionalities below (they will be marked):
      1. Extend the functionality of Quit.java class to print the number of commands executed before exiting.
      For example, before quitting the shell should print “Executed 10 commands since starting” 
      2. Implement a new command less using a class called Less.java which prints the content of a text file on the screen. Command should take the file name to be read        as an argument and should check if arguments are passed correctly.
      3. Implement a new command copy using Copy.java which copy a file from source to destination. The command takes two arguments; the source file name followed by the         destination file name.
